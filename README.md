# GHIPrediction
Analysis of the CWEEDS_2020_BC time-series dataset for GHI prediction. Implemented an LSTM architecture to predict the next hours GHI using the last 24 hours data of the sensor and its closest auxillary sensors.

Using Google Colab.

The data used is from Canada's Weather Energy and Engineering Climate Dataset (CWEEDS).
