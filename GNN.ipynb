    "#### 1. Represent the problem as a graph\n",
    "\n",
    "A GNN operates on graphs, so first we need a graph structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Nodes: Each station is a node.\n",
    "* Node features:\n",
    "\t* Wind speed\n",
    "\t* Wind direction (often split into sin and cos to handle circularity)\n",
    "\t* Elevation\n",
    "\t* Latitude and longitude (or some positional embedding)\n",
    "\t* Possibly past wind history if you want temporal modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "* Edges: Represent relationships between stations.\n",
    "\t* You could connect stations that are geographically close.\n",
    "\t* Edge weight could be inverse distance or correlation of wind patterns.\n",
    "\t* Or use a fully connected graph with learned edge weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Node features preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "For each station ùëñ, create a feature vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "\tùë•ùëñ=[wind¬†speed,sin(wind¬†dir),cos(wind¬†dir),elevation,lat,lon]\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have temporal data (e.g., last 24h of wind), you can include time-series features using RNN/LSTM or temporal GNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Build the adjacency matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "Define which stations are connected:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Distance-based adjacency:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\tùê¥ùëñùëó=exp(‚àídij^2/œÉ^2)\n",
    "\n",
    "\twhere ùëëùëñùëó is the geographic distance between stations ùëñ and ùëó.\n",
    "\n",
    "* K-nearest neighbors: Connect each node to its k nearest stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fully connected: If few stations, you can connect all nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Choose a GNN model\n",
    "\n",
    "Common GNN layers:\n",
    "* Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) ‚Äì aggregates features from neighbors.\n",
    "* Graph Attention Network (GAT) ‚Äì uses attention to weigh neighbor contributions.\n",
    "* Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) ‚Äì general framework for node updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "For wind prediction, GAT is often good if some stations are more influential than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Define your task\n",
    "\n",
    "Depends on your goal:\n",
    "* Predict future wind at each station ‚Üí Node-level regression.\n",
    "* Predict overall wind pattern ‚Üí Graph-level regression.\n",
    "* Classify extreme events (storm/no storm) ‚Üí Node-level classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loss function:\n",
    "* Regression: MSE, MAE\n",
    "* Classification: Cross-entropy\n",
